Building Binary Distributions
=============================

Distributions are generated using stdeb, execute it on the Raspberry Pi to build for the correct architecture:

    python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb

To debug installation:

    sudo dpkg -D113 -i ../python-tallypi_0.1.0-1_all.deb

To completely uninstall:

    sudo dpkg -P python-tallypi

To verify the files inside the package:

    dpkg -c deb_dist/python-tallypi_0.1.0-1_all.deb


Requirements
============

Requires python-stdeb and debhelper


Generating Debian Metadata
==========================

stdeb generates the debian/ folder automatically & this is version controlled.
However, if it needs regeneration one can save python-tallypi.postinst to a
separate directory, delete the debian/ directory, then re-issue:

    python ./setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command debianize


Running Locally
===============

To test locally, first ensure that the Python libraries `bottle` and `paste`
are installed using your package manager of choice (such as pip or apt).

Once these are installed, customize tests/localsettings.conf to match
settings for your local environment. If you are not testing on a Raspberry Pi,
you likely will want to use the mock light and power switch modules.

Once those two things are set up, you can run the HTTP server locally with:

    ./run_server.sh


Software License
================
