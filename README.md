# TallyPi

A network controlled tally light for cameras, intended for control by OBS but
extensible enough to use for whatever purposes you like.


## Hardware

TallyPi is built for the
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and
[Pimoroni Unicorn pHat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat).
It also supports hardware buttons/switches to shutdown the Pi and wake it back up.

Details on which pins to solder for the Unicorn pHat, and details on how to
wire the on/off switch, are listed in [HARDWARE.md](./docs/HARDWARE.md).

There is also an enclosure I've created for 3D printing - it's not great, but
it works as a light diffuser and includes a mount for a camera flash bracket.
It is available from this repository
or via [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4590885).


## The HTTP Interface

A web service is provided to expose the Unicorn pHat through an HTTP interface.
This controls color and brightness, and will monitor the on/off switch
(if available) to shut down the light in an orderly fashion.

An HTTP interface is provided that allows for color control and brightness
to be specified remotely. As an example:

    http://192.168.1.1:7413/set?color=AA22FF&brightness=0.3

Would set the Unicorn pHat to purple across all LEDs, at 30% brightness.

The status of the Unicorn pHat is available as:

    http://192.168.1.1:7413/status

Details on installing the software, as well as protecting your Pi for
repeated use, is available within [INSTALLING.md](./docs/INSTALLING.md).


### OBS Script

An [OBS script](./scripts/obs_tally_light.py) is provided that maps
preview/program/idle status to AV input sources. You can chose the color
and brightness for the status of your input sources, and map each input source
to the IP address or hostname of your tally light web interface.

You must have installed the correct version of Python for OBS to properly load
Python plugins. Details for setting up OBS, installing the interface,
and configuring settings are available at [OBS.md](./docs/OBS.md).
